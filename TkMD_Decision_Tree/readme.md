# Tkinter MD Decision Tree

WARNING - I am not a licened doctor and this is only for entertainment purposes.
Please do not consult this app as medical advice!

With the meme of 'WebMD' saying that everything you have leads to the worst possible illness, I thought it would be funny to make a parody of this concept. The code uses decision a random forest algorithm to 'diagnose' (not real) the user.
