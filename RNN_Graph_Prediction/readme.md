# RNN Graph Predictions

WARNING - This is an example over RNN's please do not use this for anything silly such as predicting stocks. This is not financial advice

Recurrent Neural Networks are very important in machine learning as they can help predict data through time, and find paterns that occure in a set. In this repo, I go over how to create a RNN from scratch, as well as provide an interactive TKinter UI for the user to be able to see the shifting model

## Features

- RNN from scratch (only NumPy)
- Interactive Tkinter UI

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your system.
2. Please create a virtual env with
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate your virtual env
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Main

In the terminal please type
```
python3 main.py
```

### Recursive Neural Network

This is for a one off example on how the RNN is able to predict UBERS early 2023 stock prices (data trained 2019->2022).

In the terminal please type
```
python3 recursive_neural_network.py
```
