# DNN Math Selenium

Neural Networks are becoming more popular as of 2023, and there are a lot of abstracted tools for the topic such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, etc. This is a lower level understanding over how Neural Networks work, to help better peoples view on the AI that is around them. In addition, there is also some code to showcase how Selenium and web automation can be preformed and integrated with by a Neural Network!

## Features

- Deep Neural Network (only NumPy)
- Selenium Webscrapper
- How to apply a Neural Network to learn basic arithmatic

## Installation

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your system.
2. Please create a virtual env with
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
3. Activate your virtual env
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### main.py

1. Please make sure that the local host (or website) is online. 
- Go into the Webpage/index.html
- Right Click anywhere in the code
- Select 'Open with Live Server'

2. The main.py should have all of the content shown in the YouTube video above. This will open up a safari window and prompt you with the following
```
Please select which math questions you would like to solve.
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
:
```

Enjoy!

### deep_neural_network.py

This should show examples as well as 1 test on how the neural network works

### advance_example.py

This will show a more advance application of the deep_neural_network.py
