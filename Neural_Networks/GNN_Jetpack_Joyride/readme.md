# GenNet Jetpack Joyride

Genetic Neural Networks takes the concepts of how Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks work, and uses them to preform back propagation for abstract problems. The winning of a video game such as Jetpack Joyride can be solved with a Genetic Neural Network, and this repo goes over the code from scratch!
